Synthesize a discrete signal representation of a signal given by an expression, x(t)


%This mathlab code is to Synthesize a discrete signal representation of a signal given by an 
%x(t) expression eg, x(t)= 9cos(31.4t + 0.28) for 0<=t<=7 
%using a sampling rate of n-Hz eg 151 Hz
%Assuming first sample is located at time t = 0.
